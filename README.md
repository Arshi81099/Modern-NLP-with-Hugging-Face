# Modern NLP with Hugging Face
This is a 4-week long course that helps you understand the rich hugging face ecosystem. Enables one to build and train a model for their use case.
## Week 1: Datasets
 - [Slides](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai/dlp-lecture-1)
 - Loading datasets in different formats
 - Understand the Structure of loaded dataset
 - Access and manipulates samples in the dataset
   - Concatanate
   - Interleave
   - Map
   - Filter
## Week 2: Tokenizers
  - [Slides](https://iitm-pod.slides.com/arunprakash_ai/dlp-lecture-2)
  - Setup a tokenization pipeline
  - Train the tokenizer
  - Encode the input samples (single or batch)
  - Test the implementation
  - Save and load the tokenizer
  - Decode the token_ids
  - Wrap the tokenizer with the `PreTrainedTokenizer` class
